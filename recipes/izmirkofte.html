    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I think one of the most popular versions of meatballs is İzmir meatball. So at least for me. Like any dish cooked in the oven, it is a click more delicious than pot dishes. I do not know if it is true, but I attribute this to the fact that all sides of the food receive almost equal temperature. In cookware, the direct heat taken from the bottom is transmitted upwards, its effect decreases, in short. With this logic, the six is ​​cooked quickly and the top is cooked later. But since the heat comes from all sides in the oven, all sides are cooked at the same time. For this reason, the consistency of the sauce is more intense. Again, depending on this, its flavor becomes more intense.
